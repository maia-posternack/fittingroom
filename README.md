# FittingRoom: access all your shopping carts in one place
*If you are like me, you have dozens of tabs open when you shop, all with similar items. You flip through them, comparing these items, before making your purchase. FittingRoom allows users to compare these items all in one place, including important info like price and brand* 


Note that this was a project for HackTrin, a Hackathon in NYC and it won "Best Design"
